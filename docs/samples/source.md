While the community samples are all in the PnP Github repository [teams-dev-samples](https://github.com/PnP/teams-dev-samples), the Microsoft samples come from a number of locations. To view samples based on their location/source, use this page.

To learn more about how to use these samples, please refer to our [getting started](../gettingstarted/index.md) section.
