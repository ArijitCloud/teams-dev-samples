You can build Teams solutions using many of the programming languages you're already familiar with. For solutions that have server-side code (bots, messaging extensions, and tabs or task modules that have a back-end service), you can select the language you're interested in.

To learn more about how to use these samples, please refer to our [getting started](../gettingstarted/index.md) section.
