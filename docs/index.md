[Microsoft Teams is highly extensible](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/?WT.MC_ID=M365-00000-ROGERMAN), allowing 3rd party and custom applications to run alongside the many Office 365 services already included in Teams. Use this site to browse through the available Teams app samples from Microsoft and the Patterns and Practices community.
