The easiest way to get started with using these samples is to watch our video: All samples are stored in a GitHub repository . Each sample is located in its own folder with a README.md file that provides details about what it demonstrates and any extra information to help you get the most out of it. Using the samples \u00b6 To build and start using these projects, you'll need to clone and build the projects. Clone the pnp/teams-dev-samples repository by executing the following command in your console: git clone https://github.com/pnp/teams-dev-samples.git Navigate to the cloned repository folder which should be the same as the repository name: cd teams-dev-samples To access the samples use the following command, where you replace sample-folder-name with the name of the sample you want to access. cd samples cd sample-folder-name Now follow the instructions in the Readme for the sample.","title":"Using the Samples"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#getting-started","text":"Many of these samples were created by the PnP community.

Note that Bot Framework SDK v4 is not backward compatible with v3 , which is no longer supported. Because of these breaking changes, the bot samples are tagged as follows: Bot Framework 4.6+: Bot uses Bot Framework SDK 4.6 or greater, which provides supported access to Teams bot activities (strongly recommended) Bot Framework 4.0-4.5: Bot uses Bot Framework SDK 4.0-4.5, before it officially supported Teams, so Teams messages are handled directly in the code Bot Framework 4 Beta: Bot uses Bot Framework SDK 4.0-4.5 with a deprecated beta of early Teams support. This may work but is not recommended Bot Framework 3.x: Bot uses the previous Bot Framework SDK which is not forward compatible with the current version. These bots should continue to work because the underlying REST calls did not change, but the SDK is no longer supported and is not recommended for new projects To learn more about how to use these samples, please refer to our getting started section.","title":"By Bot Framework Version"},{"location":"samples/client_language/","text":"You can build Teams solutions using many of the programming languages you're already familiar with.
